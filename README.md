This code is for a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game. The game starts by welcoming the player and asking them if they want to play. If the player says yes, the game begins.

The player is then presented with a series of choices, and the story unfolds based on the choices they make. For example, the player may be asked to choose whether to break the ties that are binding them or to call for help. The choices that the player makes will determine the outcome of the game.
